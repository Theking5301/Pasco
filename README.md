# Overview
Pasco is a web browser designed explicitly to promote productivity and efficient use of screen real estate. Open multiple pages within a single tab and organize tabs with specific websites. One tab for shopping, one tab for finances. All tabs will **eventually** be synced to the cloud and accessible on any MacOS, Windows, or Linux machine.

# Local Development
Pull this repository and install all dependencies with
```npm install```.

Then you may utilitize the included VSCode debug configurations to launch locally.
